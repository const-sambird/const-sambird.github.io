# hi there!

I'm Sam, a computer scientist and graduate student currently at the [University of Oklahoma](https://cs.ou.edu). My academic interests are centred around distributed systems, parallel computing, and machine learning. I've done a few programming projects -- for class and for fun -- that I'm broadly pleased with, which I've listed below.

I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C, C++, Java, and Python. I have academic experience in machine learning, distributed computing, database development, and creating webservices. I currently expect to graduate from university in December 2024. I have the right to work without sponsorship in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. I am looking for employment after graduation, so if you're interested, please drop me a line.

# projects

Most of my projects here are just classwork, but there are a few I'm particularly proud of:

- [mysql-server](https://github.com/const-sambird/mysql-server) was a modification to the base MySQL server to add support for a few fulltext indexing methods. MySQL already supports these, but it was good to reimplement inverted indexes and suffix trees from scratch by extending the CSV engine. While very much a 'proof of concept', it was a fun challenge though probably the trickiest project I've had to complete at university to date.
- [disdrive](https://github.com/const-sambird/disdrive) is a very silly project that creates a genuine, usable, FAT-12 hard disk within a text channel in Discord, a social messaging service, using nbdkit. Discord messages are free, so it's technically free cloud storage. Inspired by ['harder drives'](http://tom7.org/harder/), a video that really tickled my brain in the right way. That's not a pleasant metaphor, I'm sorry. It's a very, very hacky, inelegant project, which I think sort of encapsulates its ethos.
- [openscope-ml](https://github.com/const-sambird/openscope-ml) was my final project for an artificial intelligence class I took, based on an open source air traffic control simulator called [openScope](https://github.com/openscope/openscope) that I contributed to occasionally years ago. It's a fun little jaunt through reinforcement learning, and although it's a final project for a serious class I think it's still enjoyably silly to imagine a world where anyone thinks it's a good idea to put learning agents in charge of aeroplanes.
- I've done the Hacklahoma hackathon a few times with my friend Anthony, and you can see our [2022](https://github.com/anthony-nguyen-04/Hacklahoma2022) and [2023](https://github.com/const-sambird/hacklahoma23) projects on GitHub. I'm quite proud of the 2022 one, where we wrote a vaccine passport website, and while it has all the hallmarks of code hacked together at 4am during a hackathon I think it's a pretty good skills showcase. The 2023 one was a platforming game written in pygame, which isn't really in my wheelhouse, but I did enjoy making all of the sprites for it.
