# hi there!

I'm Sam, a computer scientist and graduate student currently at the [University of Oklahoma](https://cs.ou.edu). My academic interests are centred around distributed systems, parallel computing, and machine learning, though usually not at the same time, as that sounds really tricky. My other academic interests are whatever the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education deem necessary to earn a master's degree in computer science. I live in fear that I will annoy the people who run OU's supercomputer by using the debug queue for classwork. My non-academic interest is *Microsoft Flight Simulator.*

When I'm not studying for my master's, I'm usually working at the University of Oklahoma Foundation, kept safely tucked away in their call centre.

# curriculum vitae

# projects

Most of my projects here are just classwork, but there are a few I'm particularly proud of:

- [disdrive](https://github.com/const-sambird/disdrive) is a very silly project that creates a genuine, usable, FAT-12 hard disk within a text channel in Discord, a social messaging service, using nbdkit. Discord messages are free, so it's technically free cloud storage. Inspired by ["harder drives"](http://tom7.org/harder/), a video that really tickled my brain in the right way. That's not a pleasant metaphor, I'm sorry. It's a very, very hacky, inelegant project, which I think sort of encapsulates its ethos.
- [openscope-ml](https://github.com/const-sambird/openscope-ml) was my final project for an artificial intelligence class I took, based on an open source air traffic control simulator called [openScope](https://github.com/openscope/openscope) that I contributed to occasionally years ago. It's a fun little jaunt through reinforcement learning, and although it's a final project for a serious class I think it's still enjoyably silly to imagine a world where anyone thinks it's a good idea to put learning agents in charge of aeroplanes.
- I've done the Hacklahoma hackathon a few times with my friend Anthony, and you can see our [2022](https://github.com/anthony-nguyen-04/Hacklahoma2022) and [2023](https://github.com/const-sambird/hacklahoma23) projects on GitHub. I'm quite proud of the 2022 one, where we wrote a vaccine passport website, and while it has all the hallmarks of code hacked together at 4am during a hackathon I think it's a pretty good skills showcase. The 2023 one was a platforming game written in pygame, which isn't really in my wheelhouse, but I did enjoy making all of the sprites for it.

I have two email addresses that I am willing to let you know about. They should both get to me reasonably quickly.
