# hi there!

I'm Sam, a computer scientist and graduate student currently at the [University of Oklahoma](https://cs.ou.edu). My academic interests are centred around distributed systems, parallel computing, and machine learning. I've done a few programming projects -- for class and for fun -- that I'm pleased with, which I've listed below.

I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C, C++, R, SQL, Java, and Python. I have academic experience in machine learning, distributed computing, database development, and creating webservices. I currently expect to graduate from university in December 2024. I am looking for employment after graduation, and I have the right to work without sponsorship in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.

# projects

I do programming projects both for school and for fun. There are a few I'm particularly proud of:

- [mysql-server](https://github.com/const-sambird/mysql-server) is a modification to the base MySQL server to add support for a few fulltext indexing methods. MySQL already supports these, but it was good to reimplement inverted indexes and suffix trees from scratch by extending the CSV engine. While very much a 'proof of concept', it was a fun challenge, though probably the trickiest project I've had to complete at university to date. The performance boost is signficant, about 10x faster than a stock InnoDB lookup, but this solution would struggle to scale.
- [collectives](https://github.com/const-sambird/collectives) was my first research project for my master's degree. It examined how seven commonly used collective communication operations, implemented in three different ways, compared against each other across a range of input sizes. Effectively, it was an examination of how quickly different implementations performed on OU's Schooner supercomputer, while also enhancing my programming skills in a distributed memory environment.
- [openscope-ml](https://github.com/const-sambird/openscope-ml) was my final project for an artificial intelligence class I took, based on an open source air traffic control simulator called [openScope](https://github.com/openscope/openscope) that I contributed to occasionally years ago. It's a thorough introduction to reinforcement learning, and a good example of how existing systems -- even one as simple as a JavaScript game -- could be retrofitted to incorporate AI agents into their operation.
- I've done the Hacklahoma hackathon a few times with my friend Anthony, and you can see our [2022](https://github.com/anthony-nguyen-04/Hacklahoma2022) project on GitHub, where we wrote a vaccine passport website. Some of it was written at 4am during a hackathon, but it is a functional website that implements several API endpoints, and it won 3rd prize.
